## Data

To reproduce the results from the report, you need to download the dataset **`995,000_rows.csv`**.

If the `data/` directory does not exist in the root of the repository, create it by running:

```sh
mkdir -p data
```
Place the 995,000_rows.csv file inside the data/ directory.

### note to contributers
.gitignore file is already configured to ignore everything inside the data/, you can verify that the file is ignored by running:
```sh
	git status
```
